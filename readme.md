Project Description
This project is a clustering solution for news headlines that leverages machine learning to group similar news headlines together. It uses various techniques, including K-Means Algorithm, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Hierarchical Clustering, to extract insights from textual data. The solution streamlines content processing and analysis, allowing for more efficient data exploration and visualization.

The results of the clustering are analyzed and evaluated by identifying patterns and relationships and providing recommendations based on the findings. The project demonstrates proficiency in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) to enhance the clustering process and optimize the overall system's performance.
